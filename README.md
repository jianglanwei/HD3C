## 1. Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of **HD3C**, a 
Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) framework designed for classification tasks on 
low-power and resource-constrained systems.

When applied to heart sound classification, HD3C achieves accuracy comparable to 
SOTA deep neural networks while being over 350× more energy-efficient. It is 
especially effective at handling high data variability and improves accuracy by 
more than 10% compared to traditional HDC methods. HD3C delivers real-time inference 
without GPU acceleration, making it ideal for energy-constrained and 
latency-sensitive applications.

HD3C encodes continuous feature vectors s ∈ ℝᵈ into high-dimensional binary 
hypervectors S ∈ { -1, +1 }ᴰ where d << D. Classification is performed using 
hyperspace clustering and Hamming distance-based similarity measurement.

a detailed mathematical analysis of the HD3C framework. For more information,

conda activate hd3c
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```

## 3. Run HD3C on PhysioNet 2016

We recommend starting with the [PhysioNet 2016 Challenge](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/),
 which provides 3,240 heart sound recordings labeled as either normal or abnormal. 
 Pre-extracted features are **already included** in this repository under 
 `data/PhysioNet2016`. If needed, you can download the original audio dataset 
 [here](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/#files).

Each recording has been converted into a 720-dimensional feature vector using 
MFCC and DWT-based frequency-domain analysis. Feature extraction was done using 
[Yaseen's implementation](https://github.com/yaseen21khan/Classification-of-Heart-Sound-Signal-Using-Multiple-Features-).

To run HD3C on PhysioNet 2016 (both training and evaluation), use the following 
command:

```bash
python main.py --task PhysioNet2016
```

> **Note:** This project does not use a fixed random seed, which may result in 
slight variations between runs. For reliable evaluation, we recommend running the
experiment multiple times and reporting the average.

HD3C achieves up to 580× energy efficiency in training and 350× in inference 
compared to the state-of-the-art Bayesian ResNet. It also improves accuracy by 
more than 10% over traditional HDC approaches, making it highly suitable for 
resource-constrained applications in home and field healthcare. We are currently 
developing hardware tailored for HD3C to further enhance its energy efficiency.

 > **Tip:** You can reduce HD3C to a traditional hyperdimensional computing (HDC) 
 pipeline by setting `num_clusters_per_class: 1` and `num_clustering_iters: 0` 
 in `config/PhysioNet2016.yaml`. This disables in-class clustering. Try both 
 configurations to observe the impact of clustering on performance.

## 4. Add a Custom Classification Task

To apply HD3C to a new dataset, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Add a YAML configuration file at `config/{task_name}.yaml`. You may use 
`PhysioNet2016.yaml` as a template.

Update the following fields:
- `num_features`: Number of features per sample.
- `num_classes`: Number of distinct class labels in your dataset.

You may also adjust additional hyperparameters for your dataset:
- Increase `num_clusters_per_class` to better model datasets with high 
intra-class variability.
- Ensure `num_clustering_iters` is at least as large as `num_clusters_per_class` 
to allow clustering to converge.
- To simplify HD3C into a traditional HDC pipeline, see the **Tip** under the 
[Results](#performance-of-hd3c-and-baseline-models-on-physionet-2016).

### Step 2: Add Dataset Folder and Reader

Create a folder `data/{task_name}/` that contains your dataset and a `reader.py` 
script. Follow the structure of `data/PhysioNet2016/` for guidance.

The `reader.py` file must define a `load_data()` function that returns the 
following objects:

- `train_features`: NumPy array of shape `[num_trains, num_features]`
- `train_labels`: NumPy array of shape `[num_trains]`
- `test_features`: NumPy array of shape `[num_tests, num_features]`
- `test_labels`: NumPy array of shape `[num_tests]`

**Important:** Ensure that all feature values are normalized to the `value_range` 
specified in your YAML configuration file. We recommend clipping the top and 
bottom 2% of each feature dimension to minimize the influence of outliers. Class 
labels must be integers in the range `{0, 1, ..., num_classes - 1}`.

### Step 3: Run HD3C

Once the configuration and dataset are ready, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --task {task_name}
```

This will train and evaluate HD3C on your custom dataset.
